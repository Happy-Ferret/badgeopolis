badgeopolis
===========


"Badgeopolis" seeks to build a stronger relationship between a learner and their data around learning.


We are exploring three specific ideas:

Transform the backpack into a personal dashboard for a learner to track, analyze and inform their learning.

Prototype: rethinking the landing page of the backpack to be a dashboard for both small and big data


Make discovery a social and informed experience.

Prototype:


   * Pathways

      * visualization
      * builder
      * ability to favorite and mod 
      * 


   * Badge Directory

      * marketplace for learners and consumers to share info on badges "YELP for badges"
      * badge rank


Customize the way that a learner can share their portfolios and data.
Prototypes: 


   * Resume 2.0 
   * Sharing page: exporting collections into shareable templates
